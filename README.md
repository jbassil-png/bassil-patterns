# bassil-patterns

Reusable engineering patterns for statistical online learning, Bayesian inference, and adaptive systems.

Each pattern follows a consistent structure (Intent, Motivation, Applicability, Structure, Implementation Notes, Consequences, Related Patterns) inspired by the Gang of Four design patterns format.

## Pattern Index

| Pattern | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Exponential Smoothing | [patterns/exponential_smoothing.md](patterns/exponential_smoothing.md) | Adaptive estimates giving more weight to recent observations |
| Beta Distribution | [patterns/beta_distribution.md](patterns/beta_distribution.md) | Track proportions/probabilities with uncertainty from limited observations |
| Context Window | [patterns/context_window.md](patterns/context_window.md) | Limit analysis to recent history for non-stationary environments |
| Reservoir Sampling | [patterns/reservoir_sampling.md](patterns/reservoir_sampling.md) | Maintain fixed-size random sample from streams of unknown length |
| Thompson Sampling | [patterns/thompson_sampling.md](patterns/thompson_sampling.md) | Balance exploration/exploitation via posterior sampling |
